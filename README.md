# Giphy-Party-AJAX

This application does the following:

- Allow the user to search for a GIF and when the form is submitted, make an AJAX request to the Giphy API and return a single GIF
- Once the Giphy API has responded with data, append the GIF to the page
- Allow the user to search for as many GIFs as they would like and keep appending them to the page
- Allow the user to remove all of the GIFs by clicking a button
